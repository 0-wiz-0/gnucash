	  gcc-4.7 When making the text file tips-of-the-day, GnuCash
	  expects 'gcc -E' to preserve at least one of the whitespace
	  lines between entries. However, this relies on behavior of 'gcc
	  -E' that isn't actually part of the spec, and is a historical
	  accident. And it changed in gcc-4.7, such that all the
	  whitespace is removed. Work around this by explicitly adding a
	  newline in the sed expression. Pre gcc-4.7 there will be two
	  newlines between tips, but this has no impact on the tip
	  displaying code. Patch by Bill Nottingham

	  Total return is now an amount (not a percentage), and includes
	  income as well as capital gains. New column "Rate of return"
	  gives the percentage. - changed default value for "Ignore
	  brokerage fees when calculating returns", the default is now to
	  NOT ignore the fees. Patch by Sebastien Alborini
